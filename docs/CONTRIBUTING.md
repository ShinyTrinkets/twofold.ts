# Contributing to TwoFold (2✂︎f)

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! You're awesome! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to TwoFold and its packages. These are mostly
guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in
a pull request.

## Discuss the changes before doing them

- First of all, [open an issue](https://github.com/ShinyTrinkets/twofold.ts/issues) in the
  repository, describing the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any other
  ideas you have. This will help us to get you started on the right foot.

- It makes sense to add the platform and software information (e.g. operating system, Node.js
  version etc.), text examples, what were you trying to do, so we can reproduce it.

- It is recommended to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps. However, if the issue is
  clear (e.g. a typo) and the fix is simple, you can continue and fix it.

## Fixing issues

- Fork the project in your account and create a branch with your fix: `some-great-feature` or
  `some-issue-fix`.

- Commit your changes in that branch, writing the code following the **code style**. If applicable,
  you are encouraged to add a test as well (in the `test` directory)

- If you want, add yourself in the `package.json`, section `contributors`. Example: "Barney Rubble
  <b@rubble.com> (http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/)" Both email and url are optional.

## Creating a pull request

- Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request message (e.g. _fixes
  #<your-issue-number>_). Write a good description and title, so everybody will know what is fixed/
  improved.

- If it makes sense, add cmd line snippets, screenshots, etc., so it's easier to see what is going
  on.

## Wait for feedback

Before accepting your contributions, we will review them. You may get feedback about what should be
fixed in your modified code. If so, just keep committing in your branch and the pull request will be
updated automatically.

## Code style

Instead of wasting time debating what's the best style, we are using automated formatting tools. The
coding standard is "[Prettier](https://prettier.io)":

- two spaces for indentation-level
- single quotes for strings
- etc.

Just run `bun fmt` before commiting, to have all code fixed automatically.

## Everyone is happy!

Finally, your contributions will be merged, and everyone will be happy! :smile: Contributions are
more than welcome!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
